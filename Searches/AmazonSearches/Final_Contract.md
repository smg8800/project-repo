# CS 225 FINAL PROJECT CONTRACT
# nmoskal2-xs2-kevingu2-smgeary2
## Communication
### Team Meetings
The team will meet once a week, with additional meetings as neccessary. We will meet on discord, where someone can take notes in the #notes channel if needed. The duration of each meeting will be slotted as an hour and a half, with time added or removed as necessary. At the end of each meeting, we will determine the time and date for next week's meeting. 
### Assistance
Team members can be contacted on discord or via email, with a maximum response time of 48 hours.
### Respect
In order to ensure open expression, we are using discord for text and voice chat. If someone has an idea that they want to share, they are free to do so.
## Collaboration
### Work Distribution 
Each week, we will determine what work each member must get done for the next week, including one check-in day where they send a message detailing their progress and time spent for that week. 
### Time Commitment
To ensure an equal distribution of work, each member is expected to work between two and six hours per week on the project.
If a deliverable ends up taking more time, the rest of the team should be pulled in to assist with the unforseen complication, with each member taking an equal share of the workload or programming in pairs. It is the team’s responsibility, not the individual’s responsibility, to
make sure a weekly deliverable is finished by the end of the week.

If a team member(s) is habitually not completing their tasks, they may be asked why. Based on their explanation, further actions can be taken  decided by the remaining team members.
### Conflict Resolution
Conflicts between two members will be resolved by what the two remaining members decide. If 3 or 4 members are in disagreement, then the argument will be resolved by an agreed upon method.
